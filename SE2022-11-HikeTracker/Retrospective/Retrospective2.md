TEMPLATE FOR RETROSPECTIVE (Team 11)
=====================================

The retrospective should include _at least_ the following
sections:

- [process measures](#process-measures)
- [quality measures](#quality-measures)
- [general assessment](#assessment)

## PROCESS MEASURES 

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed vs. done (4 vs 4)
- Total points committed vs. done (19 vs 19)
- Nr of hours planned vs. spent (as a team) (70 vs 73.5)

**Remember** a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:
 
- Unit Tests passing
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed

> Please refine your DoD if required (you cannot remove items!) 

### Detailed statistics

| Story  | # Tasks | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|--------------|
| _#0_   |    3    |   /    |     13       |    12     |
| _#1_   |    9    |   5    |     23       |    25.5     |
| _#4_|     1    |    8    |      5      |     8.5        |
| _#5_|     6    |    3    |      15      |     13        |
| _#6_|     6    |    3    |      14      |     14.5        |
   

> place technical tasks corresponding to story `#0` and leave out story points (not applicable in this case)

- Hours per task average, standard deviation (estimate and actual)

| Estimated Average #1  | Estimated Average #4  | Estimated Average #5  | Estimated Average #6  | Estimated Average Total | Estimated Standard Deviation | 
|--------|---------|--------|------------|--------------| --------------|
|  2,5  |    5    |   2,5    |    2,3        |   2,4      |  1,3   |

| Actual Average #1  | Actual Average #4  | Actual Average #5  | Actual Average #6  | Actual Average Total | Actual Standard Deviation |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|--------------| --------------|
| 2,8   |   8,5     |  2,2    |    2,4     |  2,6      |     0,3        |

- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent - 1 (70/76,5 -1 = -0.0476)

  
## QUALITY MEASURES 

- Unit Testing:
  - Total hours estimated (2)
  - Total hours spent (2)
  - Nr of automated unit test cases  21
  - Coverage (if available)
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated (2)
  - Total hours spent (2)
- Code review 
  - Total hours estimated (1)
  - Total hours spent (1.5)
  


## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?  
Few bugs to fix and longer meetings that expected.

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?  

  Better awareness of the team, team colaboration on close an issue, how to use Docker and Docker-compose

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve?  
 More meetings to synchronize the work
  
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?  
 /
- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)  
  Improve our code with sonar cloud
  

> Propose one or two

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!  
Quiet work environment
