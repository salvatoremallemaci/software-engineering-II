TEMPLATE FOR RETROSPECTIVE (Team 11)
=====================================

The retrospective should include _at least_ the following
sections:

- [process measures](#process-measures)
- [quality measures](#quality-measures)
- [general assessment](#assessment)

## PROCESS MEASURES 

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed vs. done (4 vs 2)
- Total points committed vs. done (29 vs 16)
- Nr of hours planned vs. spent (as a team) (70 vs 75)

**Remember** a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:
 
- Unit Tests passing
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed

> Please refine your DoD if required (you cannot remove items!) 

### Detailed statistics

| Story  | # Tasks | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|--------------|
| _#0_   |    6    |   /    |     22       |    23     |
| _#1 (not done)_   |    3    |   5    |     11       |    11     |
| _#2_      |     3    |    8    |      17      |       18       |
| _#3_      |     4    |    8    |      12      |     14        |
| _#4 (not done)_      |     2    |    8    |      8      |     6        |
   

> place technical tasks corresponding to story `#0` and leave out story points (not applicable in this case)

- Hours per task average, standard deviation (estimate and actual)

| Estimated Average #1  | Estimated Average #2  | Estimated Average #3  | Estimated Average #4  | Estimated Average Total | Estimated Standard Deviation | 
|--------|---------|--------|------------|--------------| --------------|
|  3,7  |    5,7    |   3,0    |     4,0       |    3,85     |  1,15   |
| 3,7   |    6    |   3,5    |     3,0       |    3,35    |    0,49         |
- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent - 1 (70/76,5 -1 = -0.085)

  
## QUALITY MEASURES 

- Unit Testing:
  - Total hours estimated (1)
  - Total hours spent (1)
  - Nr of automated unit test cases  6
  - Coverage (if available)
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated (2)
  - Total hours spent (2)
- Code review 
  - Total hours estimated (1)
  - Total hours spent (1.5)
  


## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?  
Few bugs to fix and longer meetings that expected.

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?  

  Better awareness of the team, definition of done and in-order user story organization.

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve?  
 Partial division of the jobs by skill of each other (front-end, back-end).
  
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?  
A more consistent and pratical division of the jobs because it was difficult to fit within the time budget. 
- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)  

  More meetings to achieve better coordination.

> Propose one or two

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!  
Quiet work environment
